# Why learn SQL?

Businesses are gathering data at exponential rates, and there is an equally growing need for people who know how to analyze and manage it. (Quote StackOverflow)

Data has become ubiquitous, and yet few people know how to access it meaningfully, which has put SQL talent in high demand.

Note though - we're not here only to learn SQL. The focus of this workshop is to use SQL to solve business analytics problems using data.

# What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language designed for managing data in a relational database. It's been around since the 1970s and is the most common method of accessing data in databases today. SQL has a variety of functions that allow its users to read, manipulate, and change data. Though SQL is commonly used by engineers in software development, it's also popular with data analysts for a few reasons:

- It's semantically easy to understand and learn (after a while, it feels as through you're talking to the database)
- Analysts don't have to copy data into other applications; SQL can be used to access large amounts of data directly where it's stored
- Compared to spreadsheet tools, data analysis done in SQL is easy to audit and replicate.

SQL is great for performing the types of aggregations that you might normally do in an Excel pivot table - sums, counts, minimums and maximums, etc. - but over much larger datasets and on multiple tables at the same time.

# What's a database?

From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Databases): a database is an organized collection of data.
